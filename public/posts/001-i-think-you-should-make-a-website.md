# I Think You Should Make A Website

## November 25, 2022


Recently I've been reflecting a lot on my relationship with the internet and how, but more importantly, *where* I spend my time online. 
As connected as we all are these days, the modern web can feel surprisingly small. It's easy to get in the habit of visiting the same 
few social media sites over and over, endlessly consuming a drip feed of *content* supplied by the almighty algorithm. But in my 
younger years, back before the ubiquity of social media, the web felt infinitely vast.


When I got home from school I would spend hours on the family computer surfing the internet. Usually poking around message
boards related to niche interests or the dozens of sites hosting indie flash videos and games. The spirits of these sites linger today, but they've
been consolidated into places like reddit or itch.io. What really doesn't have a modern equivalent though, are all the weird personal sites
I used to visit.

Of course personal sites still do exist today, but what certainly seems to be missing is the cultural drive that used to motivate people
to make them. Maybe it's just because we were kids, but me and many of my friends used to spend a lot of time working on little personal pages.
Ugly tiling backgrounds, midi music set to auto-play, and ramblings adorned with low quality animated gifs, hosted on sites like geocities and freewebs.


The cool thing about these sites is that they existed for no reason other than to appease the creator's desire for personal expression.
It's easier than ever to express yourself online today, but oftentimes that means creating a profile on a social media site, many of which exist
to monetize our desire for personal expression, all the while filling the pockets of venture capitalists and advertisers. Of course this comes 
with all kinds of nasty side effects as the algorithm optimizes for engagement creating an economy of attention. All of this has been said more eloquently
before... and I really recommend you watch the video "You Should Check Out the Indie Web", by You've Got Kat on YouTube (conveniently embedded below üëáüèª).

So I really think it would be neat if *you* made a website. Not for the purpose of building your brand, or growing your following, but because I think
it's cool to have a place to express yourself that's not in the hands of some massive corporation. I'm not advocating for anyone to leave social media, 
but I think it would be really neat if more people got into making personal sites again. We need more places on the internet that exist for reasons other than farming capital, and selfishly, I just want to visit more of them. It might seem intimidating at first, but I promise it's not as difficult as it might seem to get into. 
There's a plethora of resources to learn from, one of my favorites being the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Front-end_web_developer).
There are also many options for free web hosting including [Neocities](https://neocities.org/) and even [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).


I've been helping some of my friends in the indie games community get started on building their own sites, and I'm thinking about making some tutorials to get others started too. If this sounds like something you might be interested in, be sure to check back here in the near future. And if you end up making a site I want to see it! You can send me an email at [ian@iwillia.ms](mailto:ian@iwillia.ms), or reach me on one of those evil social media sites üòÇ.
